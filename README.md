# Corona-Cases-Counter
Spring boot application to display number of corona cases
This application consumes data from a CSV file which was used to document the daily instances of the Corona Virus back when the outbreak was at its worst.
The application processes the CSV data and gives users a number of responses based on their query. For instance, users can check the number of cases, deaths and active cases in any country simply by entering the country they would like more information about.
